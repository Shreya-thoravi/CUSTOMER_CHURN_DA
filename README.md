# CUSTOMER_CHURN_DA
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
Description:
This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on their demographic and service-usage details.
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

The workflow includes:
ðŸ”¹ Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and feature scaling.
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized patterns in customer behavior using heatmaps, boxplots, and correlation analysis to identify key churn drivers.
ðŸ”¹ Model building: Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models to predict churn.
ðŸ”¹ Model evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports â€” Random Forest achieved around 88% accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Feature importance: Analyzed top factors influencing churn such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and online security services.

ðŸ’¡ Outcome:
The project provides a data-driven approach to understand customer behavior and identify high-risk segments, helping telecom companies improve retention and reduce revenue loss.
